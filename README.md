# 👋 Hi, I’m Henry — Systems Engineer (Backend & Infrastructure)

I’m a **Systems Engineer** focused on **backend engineering and infrastructure**.  
I build and run **reliable, secure, and observable systems**—from application code to the servers, networks, and cloud platforms they run on.

I enjoy working close to the metal, solving hard operational problems, and turning complex systems into something stable and scalable.

## 🚀 About Me

* 🖧 **Infrastructure & Systems**: I design, deploy, and operate Linux/Windows servers, networks, and cloud-native environments.
* 🔧 **Backend Engineer**: I build robust APIs and services with a focus on performance, observability, and maintainability.
* 🛡️ **Reliability & Security**: I care deeply about uptime, monitoring, alerting, least-privilege access, and safe automation.
* 🌍 Interested in infrastructure that supports real-world systems in Africa (fintech, agriculture, livestock, logistics, cyber-defense).
