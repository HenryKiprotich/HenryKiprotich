# 👋 Hi, I’m Henry — Systems Engineer (Development & Infrastructure)

I’m a **Systems Engineer** focused on **Software Development and infrastructure engineering**.  
I build and run **reliable, secure, and observable systems**—from application code to the servers, networks, and cloud platforms they run on.

I enjoy working close to the metal, solving hard operational problems, and turning complex systems into something stable and scalable.
